# Stages
Stages is a project where I split the development of a simple project in stages, and they are in different branches, from 1 to n.

## Stage 1
In this stage, the user can press a button in the front end, and retrieves data coming from a MongoDB Atlas cluster.

Done.
## Stage 2
In this stage, we add a post method, so the user can fetch comments and messages as well as post.

## Stage 3
In this stage, we implement sockets for a Chat API: front end and express router.

## Stage 4
In this stage, sockets are bundled with the database, so the user can refresh the page and get the data.

## Stage 5
On the previous stages, users are just people typing messages without being able to differentiate one another, and they do not identify in any way with the data in the DB.

In this stage, we create a login system, so the user has a defined link with its own comments.
