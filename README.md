# Stages
Stages is a project where I split the development of a simple project in stages, and they are in different branches, from 1 to n.

## Stage 1
In this stage, the user can press a button in the front end, and retrieves data coming from a MongoDB Atlas cluster.

Done.

## Stage 2
Add a post method. The user can fetch comments and messages as well as post.
Done.

## Stage 3
Make design mobile first, modularize SCSS.
Done.

## Stage 4
Use part of the SCSS, modules and database to create a basic TODO app 
with log in and user CRUD operations (create, delete and log in and out).

Also implemented a more solid handlebars, and now all pages just go inside views.

## Stage 5
In this stage, we implement sockets for a Chat API: front end and express router.

## Stage 6
In this stage, sockets are bundled with the database, so the user can refresh the page and get the data.

## Stage 7
On the previous stages, users are just people typing messages without being able to differentiate one another, and they do not identify in any way with the data in the DB.

In this stage, we create a login system, so the user has a defined link with its own comments.
