<h1>A connected World</h1>

<section title="theory, first model">
<h2>Succesive approximations: a simple model</h2>

<p>Let's list the necessary components:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Huge Network (the cloud, or the World Wide Web)</li>
    <li>A Client (a program in your computer)</li>
    <li>A Server (a program in other computer)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is indeed the sort of picture I have in mind:</p>
<a href="cloud.jpg" title="click to enlarge."><img src="cloud.jpg" alt="Your pc, on the right. The server computer on the right. they connect through lines, representing the network."></a>

<section title="theory, improving the model">
<h2>A step further</h2>
<p>I like to think of the Cloud as the countries, cities, towns, houses; they themselves connected through highways, roads, streets. (Or did Elon Musk invented something new?!). The network/cloud allows communication, but in this case, between computers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">We could conversely think of the "physical" world of cities, and so on, as a network. A network is just a bunch of connected parts, called Nodes. Each node would be, for example, a city.</p>

<p>This communication, as we listed, needs not only the Cloud, but a server and a client. Again, if we think of The Cloud as streets and houses, then the server is the market (provides a service), and you (your browser) is the client.</p>

<p>So the server and the client are 2 computers communicated over the cloud. This is the most crazy idea here.</p>

<p>I will just turn it slightly crazier. Web servers (the market), and Web Browsers (you) are not the only type of connection between 2 computers. But this is a topic for another post.</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Once we start a server on a computer, it can connect to other computers. A web server is basically a server that can be reached using a Web Browser.</p>
<p>(Because a server can connect to other computers, a server can be hacked out. But it's not that easy.)</p>
<p>The most interesting part is that we can share information between 2 different computers (this is phones, PCs, etc.)</p>
<p>The page you're seeing right now is "hosted" in a server. It means that this is much like seeing a Word Document, but the file is actually in my -as opposed to your- computer.</p>

<p>Now that we have a model, we can think and understand</p>

<p>By clicking a link down below, you're <strong>requesting</strong> a file to a web server. It <strong>responds</strong> with a file, if it exists, or it returns "404 not found"! </p>

<a href="test.html">Request a webpage</a>
<a href="test.json">Request JSON file</a>
<a href="cloud.jpg">Request an Image</a>
<a href="nothing">See how it fails</a>
