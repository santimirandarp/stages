<h1>A connected World</h1>

<section title="theory, first model">
<h2>Succesive approximations: a simple model</h2>

<p>Let's list the necessary components:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Huge Network</li>
    <li>A Client (program in your computer)</li>
    <li>A Server (program in other computer)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is indeed the sort of picture I have in mind:</p>
<a href="cloud.jpg" title="click to enlarge."><img src="cloud.jpg" alt="Your pc, on the right. The server computer on the right. they connect through lines, representing the network."></a>

<!-- (The Cloud, Internet, or World Wide Web) --> 
<section title="theory, improving the model">
<h2>A step further: Top down idea</h2>
<p>The previous list includes <em>Huge Network</em>, this is: The Cloud, the World Wide Web, or the internet. All of them are synonyms, and they are used in a lazy way, so be ready guess the meaning.</p>

<p>In a map, there are countries, cities, towns,... ; they themselves connected through highways, roads. For us, there are computers (cities or towns) connected by roads (links). The data (cars) flows on this roads. The Cloud or WWW is the whole thing, the map.</p>

<--!  <p class="sidenote">Conversely, we could think of the "physical" world of cities, and so on, as a network. A network is just a bunch of connected parts, called Nodes. Each node would be, for example, a city.</p> -->

 <p>This communication is between a server and a client. To keep the analogy, the server is the Market/Provider (provides a service), and you (your browser) is the client.</p>

<p>So the server and the client are 2 computers (cities or houses) communicating to each other. This is the most crazy idea here.</p>

<p>I will just turn it slightly crazier. Web servers (the market), and Web Browsers (you) are not the only type of connection between 2 computers. There are many others. But this is a topic for another post.</p>

<h2>Last bits</h2>

<p>Once a server is started on a computer, we can connect to it from home. A web server is basically a server that can be reached using a Web Browser. <a href="https://google.com">https://google.com</a> is a web server, any newspaper site, any site! We always connect to this computer providing a service (server).</p>

<p>(Because a server can connect to other computers, a server can be hacked out. But it's not that easy.)</p>

<p>The most interesting part is that we can share information between 2 different computers (this is phones, PCs, etc.)</p>

<p>The page you're seeing right now is "hosted" in a server. It means that this is much like seeing a Word Document, but the file is actually in my -as opposed to your- computer!</p>

<section title="Apply the knowledge">
<h2>Now that we have a Model</h2>
<p>Now that we have a model, we can think and understand</p>

<p>With this simple model, we can understand a phenomena like Latency. Latency is the time between the car leaves and comes back to town.</p>

<p>By clicking a link down below, you're <strong>requesting</strong> a file to a web server. It <strong>responds</strong> with a file, if it exists, or it returns "404 not found"! </p>

<a href="index.html">Request a webpage (HomePage)</a>
<a href="test.json">Request JSON file</a>
<a href="cloud.jpg">Request an Image</a>
<a href="nothing">See how it fails</a>
